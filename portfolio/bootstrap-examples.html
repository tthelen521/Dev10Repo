					<p>Hello, my name is <strong>Tanner Thelen</strong>. I attended college at 
				<strong>Iowa State University</strong> where I received a Bachelor's Degree in 
				Computer Science. I chose to study Computer Science because it gave me the opportunity 
				to solve complex problems while learning how to create software. I believe that it is 
				becoming more evident every day that software development and information technology as
				a whole are becoming integral parts of nearly every industry. I am excited to
				be a part of that monumental shift in society.
						</p>
						<p>While studying at Iowa State, I learned not only of the theoretical
				aspects of Computer Science, but of some of the various programming languages 
				and development practices vital to software engineering. I've mainly used Java
				and C for most of my programming projects and have used C++ on occasions as well.
				I also have exposure through coursework to web development, database design and
				software testing(TDD). I have experience in using both Windows and Linux and have
				worked on projects in both operating systems.
						</p>
